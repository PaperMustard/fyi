## 📊 Topic Breakdown

### 1. Limits & Continuity (10-12%)
- [ ] One-sided limits
- [ ] Infinite limits
- [ ] Continuity tests
- [ ] Intermediate Value Theorem
- [ ] Squeeze Theorem

#### Understanding Limits
A limit describes what a function approaches as x gets closer and closer to a specific value. Think of it like slowly walking towards a doorway - the limit is where you'd end up, even if you never quite reach it.

#### Detailed Breakdown

##### 1. One-sided Limits
- **Left-hand limit**: What happens as we approach from smaller numbers
  - Written as: lim(x→a⁻) f(x)
  - Example: For |x|, approaching 0 from left gives -0
- **Right-hand limit**: What happens as we approach from bigger numbers
  - Written as: lim(x→a⁺) f(x)
  - Example: For |x|, approaching 0 from right gives +0
- **Key Concept**: For a regular limit to exist, both sides must approach the same value!
- **Common Mistakes**:
  - Forgetting to check both sides
  - Confusing the function value with the limit

##### 2. Infinite Limits
- **Vertical Asymptotes**: When function values grow without bound
  - Example: As x→0, 1/x² → ∞
  - Look for division by zero in rational functions
- **Types**:
  - Positive infinity: Values grow increasingly large
  - Negative infinity: Values grow increasingly negative
- **Real-world Applications**:
  - Population growth models
  - Economic growth curves
- **Key Tips**:
  - Make a table of values approaching from both sides
  - Graph the function to visualize the behavior
  - Look for denominators approaching zero

##### 3. Continuity Tests
A function is continuous if you can draw it without lifting your pencil
Three Essential Conditions:
1. The limit exists at the point
2. The function is defined at that point
3. The limit equals the function value: lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a)

**Types of Discontinuities**:
- Removable (hole): Function undefined at one point
- Jump: Function makes a sudden jump
- Infinite: Function approaches infinity
- Essential: Multiple issues at one point

##### 4. Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)
- **Formal Statement**: If f is continuous on [a,b] and k is between f(a) and f(b), then there exists c in [a,b] where f(c) = k
- **Visual Understanding**: 
  - If you draw a continuous line from y=2 to y=5
  - It must pass through y=3,4 and all values in between
- **Applications**:
  - Proving existence of solutions
  - Finding approximate roots
- **Example Problems**:
  - Show a polynomial has a root
  - Prove a function takes on a specific value

##### 5. Squeeze Theorem
- **Main Idea**: If g(x) ≤ f(x) ≤ h(x) and lim g(x) = lim h(x) = L, then lim f(x) = L
- **Visual Picture**: 
  - Function trapped between two functions
  - Like a sandwich pressing together
- **Common Applications**:
  - Proving lim(x→0) xsin(1/x) = 0
  - Trigonometric limits
- **Steps to Apply**:
  1. Find bounding functions
  2. Prove your function is between them
  3. Show bounds converge to same value

#### Practice Problems Strategy

### 2. Derivatives (25-35%)
- [ ] Definition
- [ ] Basic rules
- [ ] Chain rule
- [ ] Implicit differentiation
- [ ] Related rates
- [ ] L'Hôpital's Rule

#### Understanding Derivatives
The derivative measures how quickly a function is changing at any point - it's the instantaneous rate of change.

#### Detailed Breakdown

##### 1. Definition and Basic Concepts
- **Formal Definition**: lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h
- **Intuitive Understanding**:
  - Slope of the tangent line
  - Instantaneous rate of change
  - Speed at a specific moment
- **Common Notations**:
  - f'(x), dy/dx, d/dx[f(x)], y'
  - Each means the same thing!

##### 2. Basic Rules
- **Power Rule**: d/dx(xⁿ) = n·xⁿ⁻¹
  - Example: d/dx(x³) = 3x²
  - Works for any real number n!

- **Product Rule**: d/dx[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
  - Think "first times derivative of second plus second times derivative of first"
  - Example: d/dx(x²sin(x)) = 2x·sin(x) + x²·cos(x)

- **Quotient Rule**: d/dx[f(x)/g(x)] = [g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x)]/[g(x)]²
  - Remember: "Low d-High minus High d-Low over square of below"
  - Example: d/dx(sin(x)/x) = [x·cos(x) - sin(x)·1]/x²

##### 3. Chain Rule
- **Formula**: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))·g'(x)
- **Strategy**:
  1. Identify outer and inner functions
  2. Take derivative of outer function
  3. Multiply by derivative of inner function
- **Examples**:
  - d/dx(sin(x²)) = cos(x²)·2x
  - d/dx(e^(3x+1)) = e^(3x+1)·3

##### 4. Implicit Differentiation
- **When to Use**: Equations where y can't be isolated
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Differentiate both sides
  2. Add dy/dx when differentiating y terms
  3. Solve for dy/dx
- **Example**: x² + y² = 25
  - 2x + 2y·dy/dx = 0
  - dy/dx = -x/y

##### 5. Related Rates
- **Process**:
  1. Draw a picture
  2. Write equation relating variables
  3. Differentiate with respect to time
