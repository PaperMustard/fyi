## üìù Chapter Overview
This chapter covers the foundational concepts of calculus - limits and continuity. Understanding these concepts is crucial as they form the basis for derivatives and integrals.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
- Evaluate limits using various methods
- Analyze one-sided limits
- Identify and classify discontinuities
- Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem
- Use the Squeeze Theorem

## üìö Key Concepts

## 1. Understanding Limits üìä {#limits}

### What is a Limit?
A limit describes what a function approaches as x gets closer and closer to a specific value. Think of it as:
- Walking towards a doorway but never quite reaching it
- Zooming in on a graph closer and closer
- Getting arbitrarily close to a value
- The "tendency" of a function

### Limit Definition
$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ means the values of f(x) get arbitrarily close to L as x gets arbitrarily close to a

#### Intuitive Understanding
- Values approach L from both sides
- Function need not be defined at point a
- Actual value at a doesn't matter
- Only care about "nearby" behavior

#### Process for Finding Limits
1. Try direct substitution
2. Make a table of values
3. Graph the function
4. Use algebraic techniques if needed

#### Example Walkthrough
Find $\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$
1. Direct substitution gives $\frac{0}{0}$ (indeterminate)
2. Factor: $\frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2}$
3. Cancel: $x+2$
4. Evaluate at x = 2: $2+2 = 4$

### One-Sided Limits
#### Left-Hand Limit
- Approaching from values less than a
- Notation: $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$
- Example: For |x| as x‚Üí0 from left = 0‚Åª

#### Right-Hand Limit
- Approaching from values greater than a
- Notation: $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$
- Example: For |x| as x‚Üí0 from right = 0‚Å∫

#### Key Points
- Two-sided limit exists only if both sides are equal
- Common in piecewise functions
- Important for continuity analysis

### Infinite Limits
#### Types
1. **Vertical Asymptotes**
   - Function grows without bound
   - Example: $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x^2}$
   - Look for division by zero

2. **Horizontal Asymptotes**
   - Function approaches finite value
   - Example: $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x}$
   - Important for end behavior

#### Analysis Process
1. Make a table of values
2. Look at behavior from both sides
3. Consider domain restrictions
4. Graph for visualization

## 2. Limit Laws üìê {#laws}

### Basic Laws
The foundation for evaluating complex limits. Think of these as:
- Rules for breaking down complicated limits
- Tools for simplifying calculations
- Building blocks for proofs
- Essential patterns to recognize

#### Sum/Difference Law
$\lim_{x \to a} [f(x) \pm g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \pm \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$

#### Product Law
$\lim_{x \to a} [f(x) \cdot g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \cdot \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$

#### Quotient Law
$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x \to a} f(x)}{\lim_{x \to a} g(x)}$, if denominator ‚â† 0

### Common Applications
1. **Polynomial Functions**
   - Direct substitution usually works
   - Factor when needed
   - Cancel common factors

2. **Rational Functions**
   - Check for zero denominator
   - Factor if necessary
   - Look for asymptotes

3. **Radical Expressions**
   - Rationalize when needed
   - Consider domain restrictions
   - Watch for extraneous solutions

## 3. Continuity üîÑ {#continuity}

### Understanding Continuity
A function is continuous if you can draw it without lifting your pencil. Three conditions:

#### Conditions for Continuity
1. f(a) exists (function defined)
2. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists (limit exists)
3. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$ (limit equals value)

### Types of Discontinuities
#### 1. Removable (Point/Hole)
- Single point missing
- Limit exists but ‚â† function value
- Can be "fixed" by redefining point
- Example: $\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ at x = 1

#### 2. Jump
- Left and right limits exist but differ
- Cannot be "fixed"
- Common in piecewise functions
- Example: Step functions

#### 3. Infinite
- Limit doesn't exist (infinite)
- Vertical asymptote
- Example: $\frac{1}{x}$ at x = 0

#### 4. Essential
- Most severe type
- No limit exists
- Example: sin(1/x) at x = 0

### Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)
#### Statement
If f is continuous on [a,b] and k is between f(a) and f(b), then there exists c in [a,b] where f(c) = k

#### Applications
1. **Finding Roots**
   - Prove existence of solutions
   - Approximate root location
   - Verify calculator results

2. **Practical Uses**
   - Temperature variations
   - Motion problems
   - Economic models

## 4. Special Limits üìà {#special}

### Trigonometric Limits
1. $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$
2. $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1-\cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}$
3. $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\tan x}{x} = 1$

### Important Limits
1. $\lim_{x \to \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{x})^x = e$
2. $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x-1}{x} = 1$

### Squeeze Theorem
#### Statement
If g(x) ‚â§ f(x) ‚â§ h(x) and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$

#### Applications
1. **Trigonometric Limits**
   - $\lim_{x \to 0} x\sin(\frac{1}{x})$
   - Bounded functions
   - Oscillating functions

2. **Process**
   - Find bounding functions
